A library of extensions to core .NET functionality.

## üëã Introduction

The core .NET libraries - those that are available on most .NET runtime versions and environments -
are very feature-rich. However, there are times when you need a little helper function, and the list
of those functions slowly grows. Rather than having disparate collections of them, this project seeks
to group them under the `WhatIsHeDoing.Core` namespace, complete with unit tests in the `WhatIsHeDoing.Core.Tests`
project.

## üì° Live Demo

Take a look at the editable code examples at [.NET Fiddle].

## ü¶Æ Usage

### Installing

This package is available via [NuGet].

### Methods

#### Extensions

##### DateTime

* `GetNextWeekday`: Gets the date at the next weekday supplied.
* `PeriodsBetween`: Generates the periods between two date times.

##### IEnumerable

* `Aggregate`: Aggregate with the index of the current element.
* `IterateJagged`: Flattens a collection of collections of unequal lengths after calling `ZipJagged`.
* `Randomise`: Returns a randomised order of the collection.
* `WhereNotNull`: Filters all null elements from a collection.
* `ZipJagged`: Enables a collection of unequal collection lengths to be iterated together, effectively as columns.

##### Integer

* `ToNearestCeiling`: Rounds to the largest comparison number.

##### Long

* `Length`: Determines the length of a positive number.
* `StripDigits`: Strips a specified number of digits from a number.

##### Object

* `AsFluent`: Calls any action fluently, such as void functions, so that calls can be chained to other
members of object.

##### String

* `AsCurrency`: Formats a string as a currency from the current globalisation.
* `IsTrue`: Determines whether this string can be converted to a boolean and that value is true.
* `Parse`: Invoke a Parse method from the TResult type on the value.
* `ToBytes`: Converts a string representation of a byte array - comma-separated values - to an actual byte array.
* `TryParse`: Tries to invoke a Parse method from the TResult type on the value.

##### Unsigned Long

* `Length`: Determines the length of a number.
* `StripDigits`: Strips a specified number of digits from a number.
