# Contributing

Changes are welcome! Please read the following advice before submitting a new pull request:

* Search previous pull requests before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Create an individual pull request for each group of related functionality.
* Make sure your editor respects the `.editorconfig` [configuration][editorconfig].
* Take a look through the source code and try and match its coding style to your submission.
* Add unit tests where possible, and run them before submitting :)
* Update the `README.md` where necessary.
* Consider how the project version should be bumped: it currently follows the [SemVer][semver] scheme.
* Finally: let's try and keep this professional, and fun if possible! For more information,
see the [Contributor Covenant][covenant].

Thanks for your help!
